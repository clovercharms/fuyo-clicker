This is the main repository for the Fuyo Clicker fangame, it's based on the
`react-ts` template of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and uses
[React](https://react.dev/learn) combined with
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to develop a single page app.

```sh

```

## Configuration

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts)
