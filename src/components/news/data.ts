            "Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male Lucky Charm and female leprechaun breeding, Fuyo is the most compatible leprechaun for humans? Not only are they in the short humanoid group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Fuyos are an average of 135 cm tall and 30.2 kilograms, this means they're large enough to be able handle Lucky Charm stems, and with their impressive size for dumpy and access to flexibility, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly Fuyonade based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Fuyo would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves ASMR Voice, Bratty Look, Hics, Kisses, and Cuteness, along with not having panties to hide cunny, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Choccy Milk and Water checks, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough fluids. No other leprechaun comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you don't pull out, you can make your Fuyo turn into a mother. Fuyo is literally built for Lucky Charm stem. Ungodly big ass+flexibility means it can take stem all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.",
